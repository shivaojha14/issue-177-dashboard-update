              <h3>Benefits of CRM Dashboards </h3>

              <h4>It keeps your team on track.</h4>
              <p className="para" >
                An in-depth sales report might not always be what your team needs to stay on pace to meet its goals. The top-level
                information that a dashboard presents can be enough to tell your salespeople what needs to get done now and what can wait,
                saving the time and effort of analyzing detailed reports.</p><br />

              <h4>It streamlines your team's work. </h4>
              <p className="para" > With dashboards, your team can rapidly determine which tasks should be done first without clicking through your CRM software to pull up reports. This function can save tremendous amounts of time.</p><br />

              <h4>It updates in real-time. </h4>
              <p className="para" > A report is a static document that inflexibly presents data for a given period. A dashboard, on the other hand, reacts to and reflects changes in your data instantly.
                This way, your team gets to build its strategy based on your most recent KPI data rather than outdated numbers.</p><br />

              <h4>It results in stronger sales processes overall. </h4>
              <p className="para" >Dashboards bring your sales team's work into the present tense, they result in better overall sales
                performance. A current picture of your sales pipeline and your prospect's progress along it is far more meaningful to
                your team than data from an old report, so CRM dashboards are especially powerful in guiding your sales team.
