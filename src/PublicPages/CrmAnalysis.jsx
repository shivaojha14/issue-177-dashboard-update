              <p className="para">    </p>
            </div>
            <p className="para"> There are several types of Data Analysis techniques that exist based on business and technology.<br />
              However, the major Data Analysis methods are:<br /><br />

              2. Diagnostic Analysis: Diagnostic Analysis shows "Why did it happen?" by finding the cause from the insight found in
              <br /> <br />

              3. Statistical Analysis. Statistical Analysis shows "What happen?" by using past data in the form of dashboards.
              Statistical Analysis includes collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and modeling of data.
              It analysis a set of data or a sample of data. <br /> <br />

              4. Predictive Analysis : Predictive Analysis: This Analysis makes predictions about future outcomes based on current

              Its accuracy is based on how much detailed information you have and how much you dig into it.
              <br /> <br />

              5. Prescriptive Analysis: Prescriptive Analysis combines the insight from all previous Analysis to determine which
              action to take in a current problem or decision. Most data-driven companies are utilizing Prescriptive Analysis
              because predictive and descriptive Analysis is not enough to improve data performance. Based on current situations and
              problems, they analyze the data and make decisions.</p>
