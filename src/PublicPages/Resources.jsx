              <h3>Why do businesses need a CRM?</h3>
              <p className="para">Customer relationship management is any tool, strategy, or process that helps businesses better organize and access customer data.
                It all started with handwritten notes but with the advent and proliferation of digital technology, it eventually evolved into databases stored on individual computers, and then the CRM definition shifted into something far more complex. </p><br/>
                <p className="para"> It was no longer just notes. Managing your business relationships with customers became a complicated
                  process. Now, to compete in any industry, you need a reliable system built on CRM software. Managing every aspect of the
                  business can be made easier with a robust CRM system. It should readily understand the business, unite it with the
                  employees and customers alike and capture the business information such that one gets a holistic view of each customer in
                  real-time.</p>
