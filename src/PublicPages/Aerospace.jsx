              <h3>ERP for Aerospace Industry </h3>
              <p className="para">Aerospace companies are not customer-driven, most of them have come to recognize the importance of
                customer relationship management (ERP) when it comes to improving sales and business development effectiveness,
                delivering superior customer service, improving the product, quote, and order configuration accuracy, and
                maximizing employee productivity and knowledge sharing, among other things. ERP software now offers a broad
                selection of ERP software capable of satisfying the complex and unique demands of aerospace and defense
                companies. </p>
              <br />
              <p className="para"> Aerospace contracts are characterized by their complexity and wide-ranging scope. Their management is further complicated by exceedingly intricate procedures, stringent regulations, and strict requirements from both clients and the government.
                A Cloud ERP solution in this environment must address the need for management of information security with exchanges as a priority from both operational and administrative perspectives in the Aerospace Sector.</p>
