                            <h3>Things to consider when choosing the right ERP system</h3>
                            <p className="para"> Before you start evaluating ERP vendors, ask yourself these questions:-</p><br />
                            <ul>
                                <li>  1. What are the most inefficient processes in our business and what do we want to improve with a ERP system?</li><br />
                                <li>   2. What operational processes and workflows do we lack and need to add?</li><br />
                                <li> 3. Who in our company is going to use ERP? How many users do we need?</li><br />
                                <li>    4. What other software do we want to integrate with a ERP system?</li><br />
                                <li>  5. What is our budget? </li>
                            </ul> <br />
                            <h4>Know what features and functionality you need</h4>
                            <p className="para" >
                                ERP software comes with a lot of functions that need to appeal to a wide spectrum of businesses. But, why pay for the
                                functions you don't need or use. First-time ERP buyers often overestimate what features they actually need. Different users
                                need different user plans. Thus, sales departments might need a ERP with an advanced sales set and a possibility to use ERP
                                on their mobile devices; while your communication team may need to only use the marketing-related functionality. Choose a
                                ERP that can adapt to your needs.
                            </p><br />

                            <h4>Make sure the system integrates with other applications</h4>
                            <p className="para" >
                                This is one of the most important things to consider when choosing a ERP for your business. ERP software integrates with:
                                an ERP or other accounting software, HR software, your own website and web forms to import new leads, billing and e-commerce platforms to register transactions, as well as marketing solutions.
                            </p><br />

                            <h4>Request a demonstration and test drive a free trial</h4>
                            <p className="para" >Never take a ERP system at face value. it's always a good idea to test it out. The best solution is to
                                start with a personalized demonstration and then move on to a free trial. During a demo session, a salesperson walks
                                you through the software and shows you how to use it. Then, you can ask specific questions that are related to your
                                business. After that, you can move on to playing with a trial version to get a good feel of how everything works and
                                see the system's strengths and weaknesses. Look at things like ease of use, key functionality, and the ability to expand. </p><br />

                            <h4>Check whether customization and training are available</h4>
                            <p className="para" > A ERP system should complement your business and reflect your sales process, your marketing strategy, your
                                customer service activities, your contact management routines. That's why you should choose a system that is easy to configure. So, when you're asking for a price, make sure to ask how much it will cost to configure the solution to your needs and to personalize training sessions.</p><br />
