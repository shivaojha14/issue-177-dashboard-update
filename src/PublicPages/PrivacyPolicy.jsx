                                our Websites, and other information regarding your interactions with our Websites. For detailed information about the use
                                of cookies on our Websites and how to manage your cookie settings, please read and review our Cookie Policy found here.</p><br />
                            <p className="para">We may use web beacons, tags, and scripts on our Websites or in email or other electronic communications we
                                send to you. These assist us in delivering cookies, counting visits to our Websites, understanding usage and campaign
                                effectiveness, and determining whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use

                            <p className="para">Logs:<br />
                                As is true with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log
                                files when you interact with our Websites and Services. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well

                                and system configuration information. Occasionally, we connect personal information to information gathered in our log
                                files as necessary to improve our Websites and Services. In such a case, we would treat the combined information by this

                                We collect analytics information when you use the Websites to help us improve them, including through the use of cookies. We may also share aggregated and/or
                                anonymized data about your actions on our Websites with third-party service providers of analytics services. We also use mobile analytics software to allow us to

                            <h3>D. Information Collected From Other Sources</h3>
                            <p className="para">Social Media Widgets:<br />
                                The Websites include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our
                                Websites. These features may collect your Internet protocol address, which page you are visiting on the Websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function
                                properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by
                                the privacy statement of the companies that provide them.
                                <br />
                                Information From Services Provided by Third Parties:</p><br />
                            <p className="para"> We may also obtain other information, including personal information, from third parties and combine that
                                with information we collect through our Websites. For example, we may have access to certain information from a
                                third-party social media or authentication service if you log into our Services through such a service or otherwise
                                provide us with access to information from the service. Any access that we may have to such information from a
                                third-party social media or authentication service is by the authorization procedures determined by that service. If
                                you authorize us to connect with a third-party service, we will access and store your name, email address(es), current
                                city, profile picture URL, and any other personal information that the third-party service makes available to us, and
                                use and disclose it following this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on these third-party services to
                                understand and change the information sent to us through these services. For example, you may choose to log in to the
                                Services using single sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider.</p><br />

                            <p className="para">These single sign-on services will authenticate your identity, provide you with the option to share certain personal information (such as your name and email address)
                                with us, and pre-populate our sign-up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities in the Services to your profile page
                                to share with others within your network.  </p><br /><br />

                            <h3>E. Other Important Privacy Information</h3>
                            <p className="para">Notice to End-Users<br />
                                Our Services are intended for use by enterprises. Where our Services are made available to you through a Subscriber of ours,
                                that enterprise is the data controller of your personal information. Your data privacy questions and requests should
                                initially be submitted to the {`${project_name}`} Subscriber in its capacity as your data controller. {`${project_name}`} is not responsible
                                for our Subscriber's privacy or security practices which may be different than this Policy.
                                {`${project_name}`} Subscribers can:<br />
                                restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;<br />
                                access and describe your personal information that you provided to them;<br />
                                access and export your personal information processed by them; and<br />
                                amend your personal information, including your end-user profile.</p><br />

                                Where {`${project_name}`} is the data controller of personal information (for example, personal information relating to Website
                                Visitors, Attendees, and individuals who register to use our Services), then we retain the personal information we collect
                                where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with our Services, to enable your
                                participation in an event, and to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). When we have no ongoing
                                legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or aggregate it or, if this is not
                                possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store
                                your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.<br />
                                If your personal information is processed within a Subscribers Service Data, we will process the personal information for as long as we are instructed to do so by the
                                relevant Subscriber that is the data controller of the Subscriber Service Data.</p><br /><br />

                            <p className="para">We may share Personal Data with various parties, including:<br />
