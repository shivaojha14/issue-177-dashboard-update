                                <p class="para">Competitor analysis is the process of identifying businesses in your market that offer
                                    similar products or services to yours and evaluating them based on a set of predetermined business
                                    criteria. <br /> <br />A good competitor analysis will help you see your business and competitors
                                    through your customer's eyes to pinpoint where you can improve. <br /> <br />
                                    A competitor analysis focuses on identifying market participants positioned to encroach on your
                                    opportunity and isolates each participant's operational strengths, substantive weaknesses, product
                                    offerings, market dominance, and missed opportunities
