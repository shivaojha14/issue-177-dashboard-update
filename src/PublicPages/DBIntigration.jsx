                                <p class="para">A CRM database is a customer relationship management tool that collects every interaction that a business
                                    has with its customers in one place and then makes all of that information available to the
                                    company in one customizable dashboard.<br /> <br />
                                    This means that support agents don't need to log in and out of multiple systems, copying and pasting
                                    account numbers into different software tools to get basic information about a customer.<br />  <br />
                                    With CRM, all of the data created about customers across disparate tools, accounts, and systems are
                                    automatically stored in the database and easily accessible to everyone on the team.

                            <p class="para">    </p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="para"><h4>1. A centralized database for sales teams </h4>
                            One of the biggest benefits that companies can expect from using a CRM database is a centralized database for their sales
                            organization. By eliminating the need for individual sales reps to do the tedious work required in maintaining their
                            databases, CRM automates the process and makes it easy for anyone in the company to get the latest information from the CRM
                            dashboard.  </p>
                        <br /><br />

                        <p class="para"><h4>2. One place for all customer communications</h4>
                            CRM also makes it simple to manage communications with all customers and potential customers in one place. Companies
                            that use CRM can see the company's entire history communicating with each customer with the click of a button.
                            The CRM database also makes relationship management simple, with the ability to set reminders and assign agents to
                            keep deals moving, while providing managers the transparency to make sure leads are being followed up on</p>
                        <br /><br />
                        <p class="para"><h4>3. Automated data entry </h4>
                            Automating data entry is another benefit for companies that implement a CRM solution. Reps and agents don't need to
                            update information about their calls or emails with clients into a different system. Everything is logged
                            automatically in the CRM solution, freeing up employees to do higher-value work to close deals and solve customer problems </p>
                        <br />      <br />
                        <p class="para"><h4>4. Organized company contacts</h4>
                            CRM benefits also include powerful ways to organize all of a company's contacts. The CRM makes it easy to see
                            whether the customer has visited a website, contacted support, requested a demo, as well as notes from agents
                            who handled previous interactions. The CRM also makes all of this data searchable, no matter where a customer
                            is in the pipeline.
                        </p>
                        <br /><br />

                        <p class="para"><h4>5. Streamlined communications</h4>
                            Companies that use CRM also benefit from the ability to streamline communications across many
                            disparate teams. Since everyone is working in the same CRM dashboard, whether they're in sales,
                            service, support, or management, it's easy to assign work, track progress, and collaborate with
                            teammates to solve customer problems, keep deals moving, and discover new opportunities.</p>
                        <br /><br />

                        <p class="para"><h4>6. Stability</h4>
                            Another benefit of CRM for growing companies is the ability to keep the same software as
                            the business grows. Companies can add features and functionality not just as customer
                            expectations and needs change but as business software evolves, whether that's new
                            shipping software, social media outlets, or accounting tools.</p>

                        <p class="para"><h4>1. Open source CRM systems</h4>
                            Open source CRM systems are software solutions that are available online and are downloaded and installed on a company's
                            servers. One of the benefits of open source CRM is how it enables companies to build and customize the solution for specific use cases. It also provides total control of customer data and is inexpensive, with many free options available.

                        </p>
                        <br /><br />

                        <p class="para"><h4>2. On-premise</h4>
                            On-premise is another type of CRM that businesses can evaluate. Like open-source solutions, on-premise solutions reside on
                            a company's servers. On-premise solutions also require dedicated hardware and IT staff to manage, operate, and maintain the
                            CRM software. Unlike free open source CRM systems, on-premise options can be much more robust and feature-rich. On-premise solutions are also the most expensive CRM options, as they require a large upfront payment to purchase the software.  </p>
                        <br /><br />

                        <p class="para"><h4>3. Cloud-based CRM</h4>
                            With cloud-based solutions, the CRM system runs on the provider's servers. That means companies do not need to worry about
                            maintaining their servers or having a team of IT professionals to manage the system. Cloud-based CRM companies also have
                            large teams of security experts that constantly monitor the system, which also features many layers of enterprise-grade
                            security protocols and measures.</p>
