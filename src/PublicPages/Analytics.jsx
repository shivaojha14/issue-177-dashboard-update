                            Organizations use ERP analytics in the following ways:<br /><br />

                            1. Customer segmentation groupings: Dividing customers into those most and least likely to repurchase a product.<br /><br />
                            2. Profitability analysis and customer value: Learning which customers contribute to the highest profits over time.
                            This involves understanding not just how much a customer spends, but how many resources you dedicate to that customer in return.<br /> <br />
                            3. Personalization: The ability to market to individual customers based on the data collected about them.<br /><br />
                            4. Measuring and tracking escalation: The ability to measure how often problems arise with a product or service to
                            eliminate that issue and quickly achieve customer satisfaction.<br /> <br />
                            5. Predictive modeling: Comparing various product development plans in terms of likely future success given the customer knowledge base by measuring engagement levels through customer shares.</p>
